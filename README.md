# Omicron_XBB.1.5
A supplemental table for the GISAID EPI_SET_230724fc, EPI_SET_230725uz, and EPI_SET_230725wh datasets used in the XBB.1.5 paper.

The EPI_SET_230724fc dataset includes 2,369 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in phylogenetic tree reconstruction and mutation frequency calculation.

The EPI_SET_230725uz dataset includes 2,317 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used in performing multiple alignments of S protein for mutation frequency calculation.

The EPI_SET_230725wh dataset includes 865 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used to perform multiple alignments of ORF8 protein for mutation frequency calculation.
